# PHP & MySQL Login System

I am delighted to present my latest projectâ€”a comprehensive login system built using HTML, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL. This project incorporates an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The code is entirely functional, allowing users to seamlessly register and log in to the system.

Regrettably, there is no available demonstration for this project at the moment.
